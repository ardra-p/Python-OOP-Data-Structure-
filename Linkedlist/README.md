# Linked List Implementation in Python 🐍

This project demonstrates a simple **singly linked list** in Python using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts. It supports **inserting**, **deleting**, **finding**, **counting**, and **printing nodes**, along with a user-friendly **menu system** to interact with the list.

## 🚀 Features
- Insert nodes in **sorted order**
- Delete a specific node by value
- Print all values in the list
- Count total nodes using **recursion**
- Find if a specific value exists
- **Interactive menu** in terminal for user operations
